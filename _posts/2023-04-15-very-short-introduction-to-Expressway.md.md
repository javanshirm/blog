## Introduction

In today's world, it's essential to have a secure and reliable way to communicate and collaborate with colleagues and clients outside of your organization. One of the most popular solutions for this is Cisco Expressway. In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of Cisco Expressway, including what it is, how it works, and its benefits.

## What is Cisco Expressway?

Cisco Expressway is a solution that provides secure remote access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) and Cisco Business Edition 6000 (BE6000) for remote and mobile users. It allows users to access corporate resources, including voice, video, and data, from anywhere using any device.

Expressway works by providing a secure traversal between internal and external networks, ensuring that communication is secure and private. It can be deployed in various ways, including on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution.

## How does Cisco Expressway work?

Cisco Expressway works by using a traversal technology that allows remote users to connect to internal systems securely. The traversal technology creates a secure tunnel between the user's device and the corporate network, allowing users to access resources as if they were on the corporate network.

Expressway is composed of two components: the Expressway-C and the Expressway-E. The Expressway-C component sits inside the corporate network, and the Expressway-E component sits outside of the corporate network. Together, these components provide secure traversal technology that allows remote users to access corporate resources.

When a remote user wants to access a corporate resource, they initiate a connection to the Expressway-E component. The Expressway-E then creates a secure tunnel to the Expressway-C component, allowing the user to access corporate resources securely.

**Benefits of Cisco Expressway**

There are several benefits of using Cisco Expressway, including:

* **Secure remote access: Cisco Expressway provides secure remote access to corporate resources, ensuring that communication is private and confidential.**

* **Easy to deploy: Cisco Expressway can be deployed in various ways, including on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution, making it easy to deploy and manage.**
