There are different methods of running the PowerShell the Windows10Debloater script. The methods are as follows:

First Method

Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location
Once extracted, open PowerShell (or PowerShell ISE) as an Administrator
Enable PowerShell execution Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files:   e.g. - cd c:\temp
Next, to run either script, enter in the following:   e.g. - .\cleanwin.ps1


Second Method

Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location
Right-click the PowerShell file that you'd like to run and click on "Run With PowerShell"
This will allow the script to run without having to do the above steps but Powershell will ask if you're sure you want to run this script.
Remember this script NEEDS to be run as admin in order to function properly.
